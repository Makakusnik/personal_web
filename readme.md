# My Minimalist Personal Web

I built this **responsive and SEO-optimized personal website** with full **dark/light mode support**. My main goal was to make myself a little more visible in the online world, as well as to show my skills and what services I can offer.

## My Tech Stack & Development Workflow

### Frontend & Static Site Generation

For the frontend, I leaned on **AstroJS** as a static site generator. It's been great for performance and SEO. I integrated **React** for dynamic UI parts, bringing in **Tailwind CSS** for easy styling, **shadcn/ui components** for ready-to-use UI elements, and **Headless UI components** for accessible, unstyled primitives.

### Content Management

When it came to content, **Strapi** was my go-to. It's a really mature headless CMS with a flawless user experience. Plus, the community is awesome, and there are tons of useful plugins that made managing my content a breeze.

### Version Control & Repository

**Git** was my choice for version controlâ€”it's what I'm most familiar with and a no-brainer for smaller projects like this. I store everything on **GitHub**, which integrates seamlessly with my deployment service, Cloudflare.

### AI-Assisted Development

I have to admit, some of the UI parts were generated by LLMs! **Gemini-Pro-03-25 (preview)** was particularly helpful for UI, and **Claude Sonnet 3.7** also pitched in. I made sure to inspect and analyze all the generated code thoroughly, ensuring it was bug-free and safe before I used it.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Setting up my CI/CD pipeline was surprisingly easy thanks to the solid integration between **GitHub** and **Cloudflare Pages**. This setup has been incredibly helpful for speeding up my development and saving a lot of time.

### Hosting & Routing

My generated website lives on **Cloudflare Pages**, which handles the static hosting perfectly. For my CMS and analytics, I use my **Virtual Private Server (VPS)**. I've configured **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to handle routing to both the CMS and analytics.

### Email Services & Security

For email sending, I've integrated **Cloudflare Workers** with the **Resend service**, making my email functionality robust and efficient. And for SSL certificates, I rely on **Certbot**; it's free and super easy to set up.

## Future Plans

This web project isn't just a standalone site; it will serve as a **template repository**. I plan to extend and reuse it whenever I want to rebuild my own personal website or even create similar personal webs for others.
